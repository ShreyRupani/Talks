Toastmaster Aju is giving his Level 2 Project 2 speech. The purpose of this project is for TM Aju to deliver a speech with awareness of intentional and unintentional body language, as well as to learn, practice, and refine how he or she uses nonverbal communication when delivering a speech.

----------------------------------------------

+ You started with a story to capture the audience's attention. This is especially important for a speech which is not an series of incidents, or an episode from your past. For a more informational speech, like yours, it is advised to pepper them with incidents to help the audience relate. Props to you for keeping that in mind when writing down your speech.
+- You chose a good topic that is a meta topic that helps us become better spekers while also enjoying your speech. However, I do believe that you could have picked a topic that helps you with the purpose of your project, which would allow you to have more nonberbal communication. In the sense that while the topic was great in and of itself, I feel that a better topic could be picked for this particular project. An incident with lots of dialogue and expressions for example would give you lots of content to express yourself with your body language.
+ I was enthralled by your speech and there was not a second where my attention wandered off. And I'm sure this was the case for everyone else as well. This is a direct consequence of a well written speech, so content wise, you were up there, immaculate.
+ Given the topic, you had a great use of intentional and unintentional body language. We could easily understand what you meant to convey and your body was well used for the project.
+ Some lovely usages of some rarely used words such as conflate. I'm sure the grammarian will point them out.
- You lost track of where you were in the speech, as a consequence of which we saw you unintentionally heading for your mouse. But you handled it well without using umms and ahhs. And had a calm pause.
- However there were some other usages of crutch words such as 'you know'
