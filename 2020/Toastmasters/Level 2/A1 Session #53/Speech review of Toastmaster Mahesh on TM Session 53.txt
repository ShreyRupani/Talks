So first things first, it's great that you broke down your speech into parts or acts, which gives the audience and index page of sorts to understand what is coming up and what to look forward to.



Volume is one feature you've had an issue with in the past. We could all see that you have made a conscious effort to increase your volume and be more audible. To have modulation in your voice as well as some vocal variety. Props to you for that!



As I was ruminating on your speech, I realized that you had great usage of pauses to show the importance and the gravity of the points that you were talking about.



You had a good operation of body language where your behavior matched the words you were speaking and helped drive your points across. I do feel the need to point out that pointing at the audience is a provocative gesture and that is not something one should be doing unless you explicitly want to provoke the audience. Pointing has it's uses, but this was not the correct use. If we have a recording of your speech, you can pay attention to this.



Another thing I noticed was that you stuttered multiple times in complex words or sentences. And I understand why it happens, when you are on the metaphorical stage, there are a lot of thoughts going on through your head, remembering the speech, understanding the audience's state, reacting to it, etc. And often the words of our speech are not at the forefront of our mind. This, is what leads to stuttering. If this was not a memory issue, it is recommended to practice tongue twisters which helps in the correct enunciation and pronunciation of the words which we are thinking about.



To wrap it up, it was an informative speech and you fulfilled the purpose of your speech, which was to present a topic that was unfamiliar to your club members, and for that, I applaud your speech.
Thank you, toastmaster Mahesh.
