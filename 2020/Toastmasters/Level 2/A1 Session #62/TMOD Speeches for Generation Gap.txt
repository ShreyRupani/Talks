"Beta, hamare zamaane mein toh..." How many of us have heard some version of this?

People born in different ages are different from each other in various aspects. But the world is changing at a rapid pace and the chasm between people of different times, widens. For instance, if we talk about India, people born before independence, our grandparents, are different from those born today. These generations differ not just epigenetically, but genetically as well. They are, quite literally, different in mind, body and soul.

"Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it and wiser than the one that comes after it.”

This difference between generations, is what we call generation gap. Society changes and hence the lifestyle, ideologies, opinions, beliefs and the overall behaviour of people also undergoes change with time. This change gives way to newer ideas, breaks stereotypes and has a positive impact on the society. We grow, we learn, we evolve, as individuals and as a species. Anyone who has seen their facebook posts from a decade ago knows exactly what I'm talking about right? That cringe! It's indication that we're becoming better over time. However, it often becomes a cause of conflict between two generations.

> But I'm not here to talk of a generation gap between a couple of generations. I'm here to talk about the difference in thinking, ethics and morality between our ancestors and us. The difference between our progeny and us. 

Before we start with the better speaking section for today, I want you to reflect on something. When we look at our ancestors, and look at the mistakes they made. Some examples would be Sati and slavery. Now what would be some things we are doing, right now, that would make our progeny look down upon us in shame? I want you to ponder about this idea today.

Now quickly moving on

No civilized person today accepts sati, slavery, or the apalling things the romans were doing in the colloseum with spectator sport, watching people killing other people, and regarding it as fun entertainment to take the children out to. We're certainly getting better, as Steven Pinker has said In the Better Angels of Our Nature and Michael Shermer in his book on the moral arc. So we're changing a lot, it's a fairly obvious thing to do, to look at the future and say: "What will our future descendants think when they look back at us, the way we look at our slace-owning, caste-system-following ancestors with horror?" For me, the obvious candidate is they way we treat non-human animals. My view would be to avoid suffering: therefore the criteria would be: Can this creature suffer? This is the criteria that Jeremy Bentham the great moral philosopher laid out: "Can they suffer?" Can they feel pain? If you think about what pain is for, biologically speaking, pain is a warning to the animal. Don't do that again. If you do this again, you might die, you might fail to reproduce. This is why natural selection has built the capacity to feel pain into our nervous systems. So don't set fire to your hair, don't poke a stick at a grizzly bear.

There is absolutely no reason, as far as I can see why a non-human animal, a dog, or a chimpanzee or a cow should be any less capable of feeling pain than we are. Pain is a primitive feeling, it's like seeing color or smelling a rose. It's not somehting you'd need intellect for.

And actually we can go even further than that. We can say that since pain is there to warn an animal not to do that again, an animal which is a slow learner, an animal which is a slow learner, and not particularly intelligent, might need more intense pain in order to deter it from doing that again than a human who is intelligent enough to learn quickly not to do that again.

I'm not sure how far I want to push this point, but I think the least we could say is that there is absolutely no reason to suppose that we feel any less pain than non human animals.
